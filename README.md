# Leo's Linear Machine Learning Companion
#### _ICS4U Mr Stubbs: Independent Study Project_
This project was completed in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), with a Jupyter notebook running Python 3. It is a linear regressor using TensorFlow.

## Project Background:
- For this project, I completed roughly 5 hours of tutorials from [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).
  - This was then integrated into my own machine learning companion, for linear regression.
- This project models [1990 California housing data](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description).
  - This project uses linear regression through [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).


## Usage Recommendations:
- It is recommended to turn on the darkmode preference within [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), as the charts are compatible with this colour scheme.
- This program uses file I/O, through Google Drive. New files will show up in the "Recent" section of Drive.
- Google Colab makes computing this linear regression possible. The school ThinkPads do not have the specifications required.
  - If you want to take full advantage of Google Colab's computing power, you can connect to GPU support from Colab.

## Other Resources:
- Google Drive [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJmPxy2qj38u2LT_MZ6D6ZhGgIsva3Ri8UFsKitiHoY/edit); including project logs, planning and notes from [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).
- I created a presentation to accompany my code and share what I learned.
